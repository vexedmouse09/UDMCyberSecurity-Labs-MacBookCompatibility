# Lab Verifications

This section contains demonstrations and validation tests showing that the virtual machines installed according to our guides function correctly in specific UDM cybersecurity lab assignments.

These verifications serve several purposes:
1. **Proof of Functionality**: Confirming that VMs installed on Apple Silicon using UTM work correctly and reliably for students
2. **Cross-VM Communication**: Validating that VMs can communicate with each other properly
3. **Tool Functionality**: Demonstrating that security tools operate as expected in the virtualized environments
